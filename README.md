Frontend E-commerce Project

About This Project
This is a frontend e-commerce website where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and check out with a final total for payment. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a clean and user-friendly shopping experience.

I initially developed this as a frontend-only project, and I am currently working on migrating it to React to enhance scalability and performance. Future plans include backend integration for a fully functional e-commerce system.
